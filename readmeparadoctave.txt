The two octave codes plot codes
    tripara.m
    navitrip.m
in Figure 4.
The data in these files was generated using the dolfin python codes
    triparadok.py
    navitripdok.py
respectively.

The code
    ploteffpee.m
plots Figure 5. It requires an input "tol" which is an input to the code
    effprimestopar.m
which computes the data for the individual curves in Figure 5. 
The other input to effprimestopar.m is the value "b" indicated in Figure 5.
The input "tol" is used to control the number of data points in the plot.
